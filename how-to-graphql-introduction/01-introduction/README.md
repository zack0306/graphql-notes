# Introduction
GraphQL aims to provide a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST
- Enables **Declarative Data Fetching** - A client can specify exactly what data it needs from an API
- GraphQL exposes a single endpoint that responds with whatever data the client requests

The need to replace REST came from three factors:
1. **The mobile trend created a need for more efficient data loading**
  - GraphQL minimizes the amount of data that is transferred over the network
2. **Variety of frameworks and platforms**
  - GraphQL aims to be compatible with all frontend frameworks and platforms
3. **Fast development**
  - With the current development pace, REST APIs need to be constantly modified
  - GraphQL aims to make APIs easier to update, accommodating the need for rapid development
