# GraphQL Notes
[Tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/)

Query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries using existing data
- Aims to provide an easily readable description of data in an API
- Allows the client to only receive data it needs and nothing more than that
- Aims to make it easier to extend APIs in the future
- Provides developer tools as well
- Allows the client to receive resources from different sources in a single request
- Organizes APIs in terms of types and fields instead of endpoints
