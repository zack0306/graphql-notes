# Signup & Login
In this section, we implement authentication functionality


## Securing Data Access
There are two areas where authentication and data protection are important in this application:
1. Securing access to the Prisma database service
2. Giving login functionality to the application's users


## Securing Access to the Prisma Database Service
If you want to access the Prisma database service over HTTP, you need to add an authentication token to the `Authorization` field of the HTTP header
- This authentication token is a **JSON Web Token**
  - Needs to be signed with the Prisma **Service Secret**
  - This secret is in `prisma.yml`
- The token is usually automatically generated by Prisma


## Offering Login Functionality to Application Users
The `secret` and JWT only protects your database from unauthorized access
- Doesn't authenticate application users
- Developers can implement any type of authentication flow for their GraphQL server

For this application, we will use another JWT
- This means we need to come up with an **Application Secret**
- It will be used for issuing authentication tokens to the users


## Signup
Signup consists of these steps:
1. Server receives a `signup` mutation with `email`, `password`, and `name` of a new user
2. Server creates a new user and stores `name`, `email`, and a hashed version of `password`
3. Server generates a JWT by signing the token's payload (the user's `id`) using the application secret
4. Server returns authentication token and user info to the client


## Login
Logging in consists of these steps:
1. Server receives a `login` mutation with `email` and `password`
2. Server compares the hashed `password` in the database to the user-sent password
3. If the passwords match, the server generates a JWT by signing the token's payload (user's `id`) with the application secret
4. Server returns authentication token and user info to the client that made the request


## Implementing the `signup` Mutation
First, define the application secret in `utils.js`

Next, we will use libraries for generating and validating JWTs
- `jsonwebtoken`
- `bcryptjs`
